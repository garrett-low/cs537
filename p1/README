README for P1B - adding a system call "getwritecount" to xv6

user/
  usys.S - Add getwritecount
    SYSCALL(getwritecount)
  user.h - Add getwritecount prototype
    int getwritecount(void);
kernel/
  syscall.c - Define system call number (aka trap number?) for new call
    #define SYS_getwritecount 22
  sysfunc.h - Add getwriteccount system call handler
    int sys_getwritecount(void);
  proc.h - add writecount member to proc struct to track calls to write per process
    int writecount;              // # of times the process has called write()
  sysfile.c - count calls to write by incrementing writecount in sys_write() body
    proc->writecount++;
  getwritecount.c - implement getwritecount() function
    int sys_getwritecount(void) {
      return proc->writecount;
    }
include/
  syscall.h - Map getwritecount function pointer SYS_* to function handler sys_* in array
    [SYS_getwritecount] sys_getwritecount,
